# Useful scripts

I thought I had a readme but it's gone.  
More Description coming.

## Short description follows:

 - **autosave-files** - list Emacs autosave files that exist, if any (for OS X Aquamacs)
 - **bct** - 'bracket counter' to help you figure out when something is out of balance (eg json data)
 - **cumsum** - cumulative sum for streams with numbers in the first column (eg output from `ls` or `du`)
 - **datemv** - rename a file by appending date of modification time as suffix (eg `datemv foo` -> `foo.20150810`)
 - **disk-speed.sh** - simple speed test using dd.
 - **fa** - **f**ile **a**ttributes - list size, dates, etc. (anything that stat produces) for files read from stdin.
 - **filelistsize** - sum sizes, or stop outputing names when list reaches a certain size
 - **harness.sh** - 	A very simple test harness for shell scripts, or to track and record output diffs
 - **how-long.sh** - watch and wait on a process and log when it finishes
 - **kwic.pl** - KeyWord In Context form of grep; regexp matches will all be lined up with context that occurs before and after
 - **linker.sh** - link executables appearing in `linker.dirs` into current directory, for aggregating useful programs from a number of folders (like if you cloned this repo)
 - **randlines** - take a sample of lines from stdin; `randlines 10` will output on average every 10th line
 - **root-du.sh** - run du on root partition in a conventional way for later comparisons
 - **root-find.sh** - generate a list of all files and various attributes, for catalogging etc.
 - **ruler** - label columns on output to figure out what args to supply to cut
 - **secs2date** - unix epoch times (eg output from `date +%s`) to human readable form (plain `date` output)
 - **sus** - list lines in order of frequency (`sort | uniq -c | sort -n`)
 - **susr** - like sus, but reverse order
 - **tail-time.pl** - like `tail -f` but prepend with a timestamp
 - **to-sortable-time** - prepend lines with a sortable time, using regexps to match dates and times that may appear on the line
 - **wf.sh** - word frequency on text (using a pipeline of basic unix utils)

## longer description and sample usage
